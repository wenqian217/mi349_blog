                    <h6>Gone with the Wind was immensely popular when first released. It became the highest-earning film made up to that point, and held the record for over a quarter of a century. When adjusted for monetary inflation, it is still the highest-grossing film in history. It was re-released periodically throughout the 20th century and became ingrained in popular culture.</h6>

<p>This is my puppy, which is also my first dog. His name is Oubao. His birthday is February 11, 2020. And his gender is male. Everyone knows that there are many breeds of dogs, and my dog is bichon. He is now eight months old, and he is still really lovely. I can clearly remember that the first day I met my dog. I wrote a diary for our story: I have been afraid of animals since I was a child. I never get close to any animals. I really made a big decision to get a dog. At the beginning, my dog was sent to my brother's house, and I was very happy every time I watched your video. In fact, I still fear that people and animals do not understand each other, will hurt each other. The last few days I've been sleeping, dreaming about dogs, dreaming about Oubao, and I really want to see Oubao. Finally, today I washed my hair and changed my beautiful clothes to pick Oubao up. At first, I put you him in the cage, he was so cute. When I got home, it was the first time for me to hold an animal. I was very courageous. At that moment, I've been wondering whether to hold Oubao with one hand or both hands, which is really a big step.</p>

 <h3>My Hometown</h3>
 <p><img src="wuhan.png" alt=“wuhan”></p>
<p>Wuhan is my hometown. I love Wuhan. Wuhan is located in the east of Jianghan Plain and the middle reaches of The Yangtze River. The Yangtze River and its largest tributary, The Hanjiang River, converge in the city, forming the pattern of three towns separated by the river. The most popular food in Wuhan is hot and dry noodles. The tahini flavor of the hot dry noodles can really float down the street and make you salivate. And as soon as you take a bite, you can't stop loving it. There are many scenic spots in Wuhan, such as Yellow Crane Tower, Yangtze River Bridge, East Lake... The Yellow Crane Tower is one of the "symbols" of Wuhan. The Yellow Crane Tower is one of the four ancient towers. It has five floors in total. Once you enter the tower, you will see many ancient poems carved on the walls. The great poet Li Bai also wrote on the Yellow Crane Tower, "In the yellow Crane Tower playing jade flute, river city may fall plum blossom" verse! Wuhan also has the beautiful East Lake. Every year, on the evening of August 15, our family will walk in the East Lake to enjoy the bright moon, the quiet night and the flawless water. The scenery is so beautiful that we can't use a simple word to describe it.</p>
